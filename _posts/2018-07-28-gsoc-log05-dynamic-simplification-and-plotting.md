This is GSoC'18 log#05. Here I will cover on what I have done in week #10-11. Link to the [previous log]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/gsoc18/2018/07/14/gsoc-log04-develop-test-repeat.html "GSoC'18 log#04"). The work during this period is mostly done in [visma/gui](https://github.com/aerospaceresearch/visma/blob/master/visma/gui).

## Done so far...

A quick solver ([visma/gui/qsolver.py](https://github.com/aerospaceresearch/visma/blob/master/visma/gui/qsolver.py)) has been implemented which dynamically simplifies the expression as the user inputs. Instead of implementing the _logger_ which was supposed to report if the input expression is invalid, I have implemented this feature in the _qsolver_ itself. It lets the user know what is missing in the input or if the input syntax is wrong.

A basic _plotter_ using **matplotlib** was implemented in the first phase which plotted the result in 2D. It is now modified for plotting graphs in both 2D and 3D. The 3D graph is a mesh which resembles the surface of the input. Given the input, _plotter_ decides (based on the number of variables and the type of input) in which dimension is the graph to be plotted.

The _plotter_ logic is:

```python
if (noOfVars == 1 and eqType == "expression") or (noOfVars == 2 and eqType == "equation"):
    graphVars, func = plotIn2D(LHStok, RHStok, variables)
elif (noOfVars == 2 and eqType == "expression") or (noOfVars == 3 and eqType == "equation"):
    graphVars, func = plotIn3D(LHStok, RHStok, variables)
```
The above snippet can be found [here](https://github.com/aerospaceresearch/visma/blob/4476efceddabb7e543332e377062e8d166591844/visma/gui/plotter.py#L22).

For example:

- If input is **x^2** , the plot **f(x) = x^2** is plotted in 2D.


- If input is **x^2 + y^2 = 5** , the plot **x^2 + y^2 - 5 = 0** is plotted in 2D.


- If input is **x^2 - 2*y** , the plot **x^2 - 2y = 0** is plotted in 3D. This case (expression type with 2 variables) needs a fix. A plot for **f(x,y) = x^2 - 2y** must be plotted instead.


- If input is **x^2/2 + y^2/5 = z** , the plot **0.5x^2 + 0.2y^2/5 - z = 0** is plotted in 3D.

Below the _qsolver_ and _plotter_ can be seen in action.

## What I will be doing next...

Almost all of the basic work related to GUI is finished. I will try to enhance the UI by adding settings menu and options to enable or disable certain UI elements. A simple option for enabling/disabling _qsolver_ has been already added.

In the coming days, I will package **visma** for all desktop operating systems(Linux, Mac, and Windows). I am looking into pyinstaller for packaging **visma** for windows. Also in the final weeks, I will write docstrings and inline comments for the code, and update the github wiki.
